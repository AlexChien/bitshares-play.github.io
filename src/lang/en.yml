    <p>Bitshares PLAY's crowdfunding is set to start at 00:00 (UTC) 2015.01.05 till 00:00 (UTC) 2015.02.02 on <a href="http://dacx.com/play" target="_blank">DACX.com</a> for a 28-day period. Investors can simply send Bitcoin to the specified address.</p>
    <p>PLS(playshares) has a fixed amount of 2 billion, 20% (400 million) of which will be distributed for crowdfunding. For 1 btc, 100,000 PLS will be offered with a progressively decreasing bonus. For the first week, there will be a 30% of bonus;the second, 20%;the third, 10%;the fourth, none. The rest of the PLS that is not given out will be evenly distributed to investors of the previous four weeks (according to the proportion of the PLS they hold).</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Simply put:</strong>：
        <ul>
          <li>1st week: 1BTC=130,000PLS</li>
          <li>2nd week: 1BTC=120,000PLS</li>
          <li>3rd week: 1BTC=110,000PLS</li>
          <li>4th week: 1BTC=100,000PLS</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>When 3000BTC is gathered before 2015.02.02, the crowdfunding will be ended in advance. The BTC that is sent to the crowdfunding address will be given back to the sent address.</p>
    <p>For example, if during the first week, 3000BTC is received, the crowdfunding will be ended with 390 million PLS distributed. Then the remaining 10 million PLS will be given to all that have participated in the crowdfunding, making 1 BTC with 133,333PLS of return. If in the end, the fund that is collected at the end of the 28-day raising period is less than 3000BTC, there will be more PLS left to give to the investors who have participated.</p>
    <p>Due to the fact that the private key of Bitcoin is the only proof for the later distributed PLS's ownership, investors must send from where they control their own private keys (like wallets).</p>

  qas:
    - q: What's the token of this System?
      a: Playshares (PLS) are the tokens of the system. PLS are designed first to be the shares of the DAC PLAY System, and thus the unit in which dividends are paid to PLS holders and delegates of PLAY are paid for their contributions to the system. Secondly, PLS are the token with which users purchase game assets (CHIPS) to play games. PLS provides an opportunity to expand the model of token distribution, and may explore models in which a game rewards winners with the tokens of the game system itself.
    - q: What currency is used to play on-chain games?
      a: CHIPS are the tokens necessary to play on-chain games. CHIPS are bought with PLS. The independent game developers are free to decide on the exchange rate of PLS and CHIPS as well as on what role CHIPS will play in their games.
    - q: What's the consensus algorithm used in DAC PLAY?
      a: DAC PLAY is using DPOS. The advantage of DPOS is that it allows for faster block confirmation and also allows for scalability to the level of VISA's 10,000 payment transactions per second. Meanwhile the system is still decentralized in that there is neither a single point of failure nor a single point of control. Delegates have the rather simple job of signing new blocks and can be fired on command if they do not perform their duties. Consensus on a whole is reached by stakeholders, whereas in traditional Proof Of Work schemes only hashing participants contribute to the network consensus, leaving shareholders who don’t mine unrepresented.
    - q: What's the Random Number Generation(RNG) algorithm in DAC PLAY?
      a: DAC PLAY is using a provable distributed RNG algorithm from DPOS. “Distributed” means that the random number of one block is generated by the previous 101 delegates’ revealed secret, so as long as at least one of them are honest, the resulting random number is truly random. “Provable” means that they need to publish the hash of their secrets to the blockchain in the next round. The revealed secret’s hash must be the hash they published last time. They can not cheat by revealing selective favourable secret because the hash of the secret must be included in previous produced block.
    - q: What's the meaning of decentralized market place and platform?
      a: Traditional online-game providers (take minecraft or game alliance as an example) can use DAC PLAY to issue their game tokens and use DAC PLAY as the public ledger to trade all in-game assets without any counterparty risk. After the coins are sold, they can be deposit to the various games and what is left over can be sold on the the DAC PLAY exhchange.
    - q: When will DAC PLAY's crowdfunding start?
      a: The crowdfunding of playshare (PLS) will start on Jan 5th, 2015 UTC through <a href="http://dacx.com/play" target="_blank">DacX.com</a>, please stay tuned!
