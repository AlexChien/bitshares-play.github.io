# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization

# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es

      title: 关于DACPLAY路线图的重大调整
      body: |
             <div class="release"><p>区块链技术的发展日新月异，在14年DACPLAY<a href="https://dacplay.org/cn/#whitepaper">旧版白皮书</a>出来当时，市面上还没有成熟的智能合约框架，当时以太坊的第一个版本还没有出来，DACPLAY项目本身发源于比特股社区，为了实现游戏合约以及支持更强的可扩展功能，DACPLAY基于比特股1.0的框架开发了一些列有趣的娱乐性应用，包括有奖日志，简单游戏，红包等等，得到了用户的肯定和好评。后来为了构建可以扩展的生态系统，我们继续集中精力研发自己的合约脚本系统，为此，我们花费了大量的时间，将V8的Javascript脚本引擎嵌入到比特股1.0的开发框架中，并实现了让第三方开发者可以在DACPLAY上开发游戏的脚本合约。</p>
             <p>后来因为比特股1.0技术框架的一些漏洞，DACPLAY的系统经历了<a href="http://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309403988755882092781">一次严重的攻击</a> ，在这次攻击之后，开发者团队决定将技术框架升级至石墨烯，也就是比特股2.0的技术框架，因为这次升级，原先的V8的Javascript脚本引擎也需要做相应升级。在区块链的底层协议以及支持V8智能合约的开发上，开发团队花费了大量时间精力和时间，却没有得到一个满意的成熟智能合约框架。长时间的熊市对团队开发资金和游戏合约生态社区构建也产生影响。然而，在过去的两年中，以太坊等通用智能合约平台发展壮大起来，为我们提供了更成熟更好的技术框架和平台，经过反思和总结，我们突然发现，开发团队一直尝试开发的底层平台已经有了现成的并且更好的选择，例如以太坊等等，我们问自己一个问题：何不直接在以太坊上面开发应用平台？为此，我们对以太坊做了一些深入学习和研究，发现技术上基本的条件已经具备，虽然在性能上可能有所影响，但是能够用solidity开发和支持的游戏种类已经非常多种多样，具备构成DACPLAY生态的条件。在以太坊上开发应用的一个好处是可以兼容很多的协议，例如ERC-20协议，Bancor协议等等，可以立即获得支持这些协议应用的好处，而且越来越多的协议正在被开发出来，最近一段时间，基于智能合约开发的区块链应用有繁荣壮大的趋势，像DigixDao, FirstBlood，MakerDAO, Augur, BAT，Aragon, Status等应用都发展的很不错。并且，也有很多其他的通用的支持智能合约的区块链项目出现，像EOS等等，我们发现，通用的区块链技术平台（特别是支持EVM兼容的）和区块链应用分离正在成为一个趋势，我们团队可能很难同时做好这两件事，选择站在巨人的肩膀上，是更聪明的选择。</p>
             <p>因此，经过开发团队的慎重考虑，我们决定对目前的技术框架做出一个大的方向调整：选择直接在以太坊公链网络上开发DACPLAY的一套合约来实现白皮书中的设计，而非自己设计开发一套独立的链。因为技术路线的调整，也吸取了过去的一些经验教训，我们对路线图和社区也会做出一些大的调整。</p>
             <p>这些调整主要包括：</p>
             <ol>
               <li>
                 <p>由基于石墨烯+V8脚本合约的技术路线，切换至直接在以太坊公链上开发一套智能合约。这些合约包括但不仅限于(目前为Draft版本)：</p>
               </li>
               <ol>
                 <li>
                   <p>PLAY新的<a href="https://github.com/dacplayproject">Github库</a>，用于管理这一套合约。</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>一个兼容ERC-20的PLS Token合约，并支持将原先链上的PLS Token 1:1迁移过来，以及相应的Token迁移支持代码。</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>Chip合约，主要实现的功能包括，游戏Chip资产和合约的注册与兑换，预留给游戏合约调用的账户余额更新接口。调用账户余额更新服务，PLS将作为燃料和手续费被消耗。每种游戏Chip资产的账户余额更新接口只能被对应注册的游戏合约调用。</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>内置和外置的随机数服务合约，PLS将作为内置随机数合约的燃料。</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>自动化治理和管理升级的合约</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>各种游戏合约（含不依赖随机数的竞猜，对赌等合约和依赖随机数的合约两大类）</p>

               </ol>
               <li>
                 <p>路线图的调整：停止原先基于石墨烯框架开发支持V8游戏脚本合约的计划，转而实现一套合约应用，分几个阶段：</p>
               </li>
               <ol>
                 <li>
                   <p>旧的DACPLAY 2.0系统和Token的迁移工作(1-2个月)</p>
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   <p>测试一些游戏合约以及测试合约框架(正在进行中)</p>
                 </li>

      title: DAC PLAY Crowdfunding
      content: |
        <p>Bitshares PLAY's crowdfunding is set to start at 00:00 (UTC) 2015.01.05 till 00:00 (UTC) 2015.02.02 on <a href="http://dacx.com/play" target="_blank">DACX.com</a> for a 28-day period. Investors can simply send Bitcoin to the specified address.</p>
        <p>PLS(playshares) has a fixed amount of 2 billion, 20% (400 million) of which will be distributed for crowdfunding. For 1 btc, 100,000 PLS will be offered with a progressively decreasing bonus. For the first week, there will be a 30% of bonus;the second, 20%;the third, 10%;the fourth, none. The rest of the PLS that is not given out will be evenly distributed to investors of the previous four weeks (according to the proportion of the PLS they hold).</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Simply put:</strong>：
            <ul>
              <li>1st week: 1BTC=130,000PLS</li>
              <li>2nd week: 1BTC=120,000PLS</li>
              <li>3rd week: 1BTC=110,000PLS</li>
              <li>4th week: 1BTC=100,000PLS</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>When 3000BTC is gathered before 2015.02.02, the crowdfunding will be ended in advance. The BTC that is sent to the crowdfunding address will be given back to the sent address.</p>
        <p>For example, if during the first week, 3000BTC is received, the crowdfunding will be ended with 390 million PLS distributed. Then the remaining 10 million PLS will be given to all that have participated in the crowdfunding, making 1 BTC with 133,333PLS of return. If in the end, the fund that is collected at the end of the 28-day raising period is less than 3000BTC, there will be more PLS left to give to the investors who have participated.</p>
        <p>Due to the fact that the private key of Bitcoin is the only proof for the later distributed PLS's ownership, investors must send from where they control their own private keys (like wallets).</p>

      title: FAQ
      subtitle:
      qas:
        - q: What's the token of this System?
          a: Playshares (PLS) are the tokens of the system. PLS are designed first to be the shares of the DAC PLAY System, and thus the unit in which dividends are paid to PLS holders and delegates of PLAY are paid for their contributions to the system. Secondly, PLS are the token with which users purchase game assets (CHIPS) to play games. PLS provides an opportunity to expand the model of token distribution, and may explore models in which a game rewards winners with the tokens of the game system itself.
        - q: What currency is used to play on-chain games?
          a: CHIPS are the tokens necessary to play on-chain games. CHIPS are bought with PLS. The independent game developers are free to decide on the exchange rate of PLS and CHIPS as well as on what role CHIPS will play in their games.
        - q: What's the consensus algorithm used in DAC PLAY?
          a: DAC PLAY is using DPOS. The advantage of DPOS is that it allows for faster block confirmation and also allows for scalability to the level of VISA's 10,000 payment transactions per second. Meanwhile the system is still decentralized in that there is neither a single point of failure nor a single point of control. Delegates have the rather simple job of signing new blocks and can be fired on command if they do not perform their duties. Consensus on a whole is reached by stakeholders, whereas in traditional Proof Of Work schemes only hashing participants contribute to the network consensus, leaving shareholders who don’t mine unrepresented.
        - q: What's the Random Number Generation(RNG) algorithm in DAC PLAY?
          a: DAC PLAY is using a provable distributed RNG algorithm from DPOS. “Distributed” means that the random number of one block is generated by the previous 101 delegates’ revealed secret, so as long as at least one of them are honest, the resulting random number is truly random. “Provable” means that they need to publish the hash of their secrets to the blockchain in the next round. The revealed secret’s hash must be the hash they published last time. They can not cheat by revealing selective favourable secret because the hash of the secret must be included in previous produced block.
        - q: What's the meaning of decentralized market place and platform?
          a: Traditional online-game providers (take minecraft or game alliance as an example) can use DAC PLAY to issue their game tokens and use DAC PLAY as the public ledger to trade all in-game assets without any counterparty risk. After the coins are sold, they can be deposit to the various games and what is left over can be sold on the the DAC PLAY exhchange.
        - q: When will DAC PLAY's crowdfunding start?
          a: The crowdfunding of playshare (PLS) will start on Jan 5th, 2015 UTC through <a href="http://dacx.com/play" target="_blank">DacX.com</a>, please stay tuned!
